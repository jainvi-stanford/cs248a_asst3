# CS 248A Assignment 3: Path Tracer (Due Feb 27, 11:59 PM PST)

## Environment Setup

Please read the [top level README.md](../README.md) for instructions on how to set up the environment for this assignment.

## Migrate from Assignment 2

This assignment builds upon the ray caster and texture functionality you implemented as part of last 2 assignments. To migrate your code from Assignment 2 to Assignment 3, please follow the migration guide in [asst2-migration-guide.md](./asst3-migration-guide.md). You need to change only 3 functions, and we've provided a script that takes path of your assignment 2 directory and copies the unmodified files directly to assignment 3.

## Download 3D Models

This assignment uses several 3D models for testing and rendering. Please download the models from [this google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kT2JPlwDfBr8oHNwdRPJnOsRY1iFvcUD?usp=drive_link)

Place all the files under the `resources` folder in the root of the repository. Note that this folder is ignored by `.gitignore`, so if you are collaborating with your partner, please make sure both of you download the models.

## What you will do

In this assignment you will add lights, BRDF's to the scene. Then you'll implement a path tracer with global illumination to render photorealistic images of a scene.

### Getting started 

Please open [the path tracer notebook](../notebooks/assignment3/pathtracer.ipynb) and follow the instructions in the notebook.


The starter code also comes with an interactive renderer that allows you to move around and render 3D scenes in real time. Follow the [interactive renderer guide](../docs/interactive-renderer.md) to learn how to use it.

### Grading and Handin

Assignment handin will be done on Gradescope.

All programming assignments in CS248A will be graded via a 15 minute in-person conversation with a course CA.  The CAs will ask you to render various scenes, and ask you questions about your code.  Your grade will be a function of both your ability to demonstrate correct code and your team's ability to answer CA questions about the code.
